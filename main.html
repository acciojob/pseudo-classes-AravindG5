	<p>The :root CSS pseudo-class matches the root element of a tree representing the document. In HTML, :root represents the <html> element and is identical to the selector html, except that its specificity is higher./p>
	<p>The :nth-child() CSS pseudo-class matches elements based on the indexes of the elements in the child list of their parents. In other words, the :nth-child() selector selects child elements according to their position among all the sibling elements within a parent element.</p>
